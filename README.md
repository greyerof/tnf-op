## Description

Kubernetes/Openshift Operator (scaffolded with operator-sdk) running the
[CNF Certification Suite Container](https://github.com/test-network-function/cnf-certification-test).

The CNF Certification Suites provide a set of test cases for the
Containerized Network Functions/Cloud Native Functions (CNFs) to verify if
best practices for deployment on Red Hat OpenShift clusters are followed.

### How does it work?

The Operator uses a CR representing a CNF Certification Suites run.
In order to run the suites, such "run" CR has to be created together
with a Config Map containing the cnf certification suites configuration,
and a Secret containing the preflight suite credentials.

See resources relationship diagram:

![run config](doc/uml/run_config.png)

When the CR is deployed, a new pod with two containers is created:

1. Container built with the cnf certification image in order to run the suites.
2. Container which creates a new CR representing the CNF Certification suites
results based on results claim file created by the previous container.

    See container's flow in the following diagram:

**See diagram summarizing the process:**

![Use Case Run](doc/uml/use_case_run.png)

## Getting Started

Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against.
You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing,
or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your
kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Install operator

#### Iniital steps

1. Clone Cnf Certification Operator repo:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/greyerof/tnf-op.git
    ```

2. Install cert-manager:

    ```sh
    kubectl apply -f https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/latest/download/cert-manager.yaml
    ```

#### Option 1: Use a your own registry account

1. Export images environment variables:

    ```sh
    export IMG=<your-registry.com>/<your-repo>/cnf-certsuite-operator:<version>
    export SIDECAR_IMG=<your-registry.com>/<your-repo>/cnf-certsuite-operator-sidecar:<version>
    ```

2. Build and upload the controller image to your registry account:

    ```sh
    make docker-build docker-push
    ```

3. Build and upload the side car image to your registry account:

    ```sh
    docker build -f cnf-cert-sidecar/Dockerfile -t $SIDECAR_IMG .
    docker push $SIDECAR_IMG
    ```

4. Deploy the operator, using the previously uploaded controller image,
 and the built side car image:

    ```sh
    make deploy
    ```

#### Option 2: Use local images

1. Export images environment variables:

    ```sh
    export IMG=<your-cnf-certsuite-operator-image-name>
    export SIDECAR_IMG=<your-sidecar-app-image-name>
    ```

2. Build controller and side car images:

    ```sh
    scripts/ci/build.sh
    ```

3. Deploy previously built images by preloading them into the kind cluster's nodes:

    ```sh
    scripts/ci/deploy.sh
    ```

### Test it out

Use our samples to test out the cnf certification operator, with the following command:

```sh
make deploy-samples
```

### Running test suites on the cluster

1. Create Resources

    In order to use the cnf certification suite operator,
    you'll have to create yaml files for the following resources:

    1. Config map:\
    Containing the cnf certification configuration file
    content under the `tnf_config.yaml` key.\
    (see [CNF Certification configuration description](https://test-network-function.github.io/cnf-certification-test/configuration/))

    2. Secret:\
    Containing cnf preflight suite credentials
    under the `preflight_dockerconfig.json` key.\
    (see [Preflight Integration description](https://test-network-function.github.io/cnf-certification-test/runtime-env/#disable-intrusive-tests))

    3. CnfCertificationSuiteRun CR:\
    Containing the following Spec fields that has to be filled in:
        - **labelsFilter**: Wanted label filtering the cnf certification tests suite.
        - **logLevel**: Wanted log level of cnf certification tests suite run.\
        Log level options: "info", "debug", "warn", "error"
        - **timeout**: Wanted timeout for the the cnf certification tests.
        - **configMapName**: Name of the config map defined at stage 1.
        - **preflightSecretName**: Name of the preflight Secret
        defined at stage 2.
        - **enableDataCollection**: Set to "true" to enable data collection,
        or "false" otherwise\
        **Note:** Current operator's version **doesn't** support
        setting enableDataCollection to "true".

        See a [sample CnfCertificationSuiteRun CR](https://github.com/greyerof/tnf-op/blob/main/config/samples/cnf-certifications_v1alpha1_cnfcertificationsuiterun.yaml)

    **Note:** All resources have to be defined
    under the `cnf-certsuite-operator` namespace.

2. Apply resources into the cluster

    After creating all the yaml files for required resources,
    use the following commands to apply them into the cluster:

    ```sh
    oc apply -f /path/to/config/map.yaml
    oc apply -f /path/to/preflight/secret.yaml
    oc apply -f /path/to/cnfCertificationSuiteRun.yaml
    ```

    **Note**: The same config map and secret can be reused
    by different CnfCertificationSuiteRun CR's.

### Review results

If all of the resources were applied successfully, the cnf certification suites
will run on a new created `pod` in the `cnf-certsuite-operator` namespace.

Check whether the pod creation and the cnf certification suites run were successful
by checking CnfCertificationSuiteRun CR's status, using the following command:

```sh
oc get cnfcertificationsuiteruns.cnf-certifications.redhat.com -n cnf-certsuite-operator
```

In the successful case, expect to see the following status:

```sh
NAME                              AGE   STATUS
cnfcertificationsuiterun-sample   50m   CertSuiteFinished
```

When the pod is completed, a new `CnfCertificationSuiteReport` will be created
under the same namespace.
CNF certification suites results will be stored in the CR's Status different fields:

- Results: For every test case, contains its result and logs.
If the the result is "skipped" or "failed" contains also the skip\failure reason.

    See example:

    ```sh
    Logs:            INFO  [Feb 15 10:46:43.050] [check.go: 263] [observability-crd-status]

    ```

- Summary: Summarize the total number of tests by their results.
- Verdict: Specifies the overall result of the CNF certificattion suites run.\
Poissible verdicts: "pass", "skip", "fail", "error".

Run the following command to ensure its creation:

```sh
oc get cnfcertificationsuitereports.cnf-certifications.redhat.com -n cnf-certsuite-operator
```

To review the test results describe the created
`CnfCertificationSuiteReport` run the following command:

```sh
oc describe cnfcertificationsuitereports.cnf-certifications.redhat.com \
-n cnf-certsuite-operator <report`s name>
```

### Uninstall CRDs

To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller

UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
