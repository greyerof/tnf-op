## Description

Kubernetes/Openshift Operator (scaffolded with operator-sdk) running the
[CNF Certification Suite Container](https://github.com/test-network-function/cnf-certification-test).

## Getting Started

Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against.
You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing,
or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your
kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Install operator

Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=quay.io/testnetworkfunction/cnf-certsuite-operator:<tag>
```

### Running test suites on the cluster

#### 1. Create Resources

In order to use the cnf certification suite operator,
you'll have to create yaml files for the following resources:

1. Config map:\
Containing the cnf certification configuration file
content under the `tnf_config.yaml` key.\
(see [CNF Certification configuration description](https://test-network-function.github.io/cnf-certification-test/configuration/))

2. Secret:\
Containing cnf preflight suite credentials
under the `preflight_dockerconfig.json` key.\
(see [Preflight Integration description](https://test-network-function.github.io/cnf-certification-test/runtime-env/#disable-intrusive-tests))

3. CnfCertificationSuiteRun CR:\
Containing the following Spec fields that has to be filled in:
    - **labelsFilter**: Wanted label filtering the cnf certification tests suite.
    - **logLevel**: Wanted log level of cnf certification tests suite run.
    - **timeout**: Wanted timeout for the the cnf certification tests.
    - **configMapName**: Name of config map defined at stage 1.
    - **preflightSecretName**: Name of preflight Secret defined at stage 2.

    See a [sample CnfCertificationSuiteRun CR](https://github.com/greyerof/tnf-op/blob/main/config/samples/cnf-certifications_v1alpha1_cnfcertificationsuiterun.yaml)

**Note:** All resources have to be defined under the `cnf-certsuite-operator` namespace.

#### 2. Apply resources into the cluster

After creating all the yaml files for required resources,
use the following commands to apply them into the cluster:

```sh
oc apply -f /path/to/config/map.yaml
oc apply -f /path/to/preflight/secret.yaml
oc apply -f /path/to/cnfCertificationSuiteRun.yaml
```

**Note**: The same config map and secret can be reused
by different CnfCertificationSuiteRun CR's.

#### 3. Review results

If all of the resources were applied successfully, the cnfcertification suites
will run on a new created `pod` in the `cnf-certsuite-operator` namespace.

When the pod is completed, a new `CnfCertificationSuiteReport` will be created
under the same namespace. Run the following command to ensure its creation:

```sh
oc get cnfcertificationsuitereports.cnf-certifications.redhat.com -n cnf-certsuite-operator
```

To review the test results describe the created
`CnfCertificationSuiteReport` run the following command:

```sh
oc describe cnfcertificationsuitereports.cnf-certifications.redhat.com \
-n cnf-certsuite-operator <report`s name>
```

### Uninstall CRDs

To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller

UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
